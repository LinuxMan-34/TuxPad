First, go ahead and download the file called: tuxpad.py on the TuxPad repository home page.   (MAKE SURE TKINTER IS INSTALLED BY TYPING THIS IS THE TERMINAL: apt-get install python3-tk)

Second, CD into where the file is

Third, make sure your Linux system is up to date by typing this command in the terminal: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
 cha
Fourth, type chmod +x tuxpad.py (which makes the .py file executable) and also type in sudo cp tuxpad.py /usr/local/bin/ (which moves the .py file into the specified directory, change if you would want the file in a different directory like Desktop.)

Fifth (and last), open the  .py file that you dowloaded on the first step and it should run!


ALSO, This should work for EVERY version of TuxPad
