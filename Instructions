First, go ahead and download the files from the tux_type part in our repository.

Second, CD into where the files are (also put the files into a folder called tux_pad so this can work.)

Third, make sure your Linux system is up to date by typing this command in the terminal: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
 
Fourth, type chmod +x tuxpad.py (which makes the .py file executable) and also type in sudo cp tuxpad.py /usr/local/bin/ (which moves the .py file into the specified directory.)

Fifth (and last), open the .desktop file or the .py file that you dowloaded on the first step and it should run!
