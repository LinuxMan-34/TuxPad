First, go ahead and download the files from the Downloads part in our repository.

Second, make sure your Linux system is up to date by typing this command in the terminal: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
 
Third, type chmod +x tuxtype.py (which makes the .py file executable) and also type in sudo cp tuxtype.py /usr/local/bin/ (which moves the .py file into the specified directory.)

Fourth (and last), open the .desktop file that you dowloaded on the first step and it should run!
