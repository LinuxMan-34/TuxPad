When opening the .desktop file, it will say about a untrusted executor 
please know that this isnt malicous and any other types of TuxPad ARE NOT MADE BY ME, if anyone does make a malicous TuxPad virus then
report them. The code is open source so if u feel that the official TuxPad or any other TuxPad is a bit dodgey, please make sure to check the .py file.
If there is a TuxPad type that is closed source, DO NOT USE IT, its likely trying to cover up malicous code as this is a very simple software.
